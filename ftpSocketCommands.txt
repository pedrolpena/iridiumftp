In order to send commands and receive responses from the ftp message manager,
any client that connects must identify itself with the name command.

For example, after establishing a socket connection,
send the following.

"<NAME>command</NAME>" followed by an "ACK"

Once set, the message manager will forward commands from this socket to the command processor client.
Once processed by the command processor client, the message mananger will know to route repsonses to all clients
named "command".


All commands must be enclosed in "<CMD>some_command</CMD>" and followed by and "ACK"
All accepted command responses will be in the form of "<CMDREPLY>value(s)</CMDREPLY>"
All rejeceted command responses will be in the form of "<CMDERROR>error message</CMDERROR>"
